As long as you refer back to us in an easily accessible part of your Application/OS you may use & modify this freely, it would also be nice if you donate what you think is appropriate once we set the feature up (Won't be until the GUI framework is ready).

If you're app/os gains a lot of fame then we will add a link here for it, commercially funded links will be worked out later if this gains enough popularity.

After having read some [simpler](http://www.reactos.org/node/724) explanations of the GPL, LGPL BSD and MIT Licenses it was decided that as a framework zxs would be better off on the LGPL License.
